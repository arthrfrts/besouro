The new, improved site for Brazilian film production company [Besouro Filmes](http://besourofilmes.com/).

This site is made purely with HTML and CSS, with minor JavaScript for responsive video embeds. I would like to continue using as minimal JavaScript as possible on this project, due to the already increased page bloat of it's high resolution images and videos. The new site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and its contents are managed via [SiteLeaf](https://siteleaf.com/).

**Besouro Filmes team members:** the wiki in this repository has a guide on how manage the content of this site via SiteLeaf (in Portuguese).
