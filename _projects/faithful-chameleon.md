In the middle of the pre-shaped landscapes of Gramado (a European immigrant town in southern Brazil), Marcel, a flight attendant stays in his family’s hotel eight years after his departure. His visit and the lethargy of the end of the year festivities coincide with his cousin’s death. Just like the artificial landscapes, Marcel projects an imagined existence.
