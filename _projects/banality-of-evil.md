Thefts, armed robbery and corruption are common topics in the news programs of a state that can't protect from itself. A mix of tragedy and entertainment. _Banality of Evil_ isn't any TV series, in it people are resentful. For the policeman, there is no difference between public and private, especially when you look where you shouldn't.
