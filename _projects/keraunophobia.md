Alice (Fernanda Petit) is an ordinary girl, who goes unnoticed by people and has serious issues regarding thunderstorms. Pedro (Frederico Vasques) is a popular guy, full of friends, with a loving family. But when he loses his sight, he gradually isolates himself from everything around him and that is how these two unlikely stories meet, because they are unique.
