Principal flute of the Porto Alegre Symphony Orchestra, the 30 years old musician Klaus Volkmann is the purest expression of someone connected with a simple and sustainable way of life, transportation and direct contact with the city and the nature. A way of thinking that led him to face existence as something potentially capable of branching out in any direction.
