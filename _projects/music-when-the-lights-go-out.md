_Music when the lights go out_ is a documentary floating on this thin border between fiction and reality. An author comes to a small city in Brazil’s countryside, to turn Emelyn’s life into a fictional narrative. The more the author teases Emelyn with cameras, the more she becomes Bernard, a teenager boy divided between living the desire and continuing desiring.
