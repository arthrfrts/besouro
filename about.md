{% include figure.html src="/assets/media/equipe.jpg" alt="The people behind Besouro Filmes" class="full-width" %}

We work as allies of our directors. We produce universal stories that take us to a different world and move people. Movies for the public.

Besouro Films was created in 2006 by a group of friends from the first Filmmaking graduation course in Rio Grande do Sul. Young people who have, from a very early stage, collected experiences and prizes in the areas in which they work. Based in Porto Alegre and focused on content production, Besouro works in partnership with other companies and directors, seeking an unique identity in its works.
